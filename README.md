Introduction
Phishing is a prevalent cybersecurity threat that exploits human trust to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and personal details. 
These attacks often use deceptive URLs to lure victims into providing their information on fake websites.
The Phishing URL Detection system seeks to mitigate this risk by developing a machine learning model that can distinguish between phishing and legitimate URLs. 
The system's Graphical user interface enables users to input URLs and receive immediate feedback on their legitimacy.
